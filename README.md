Image processing and computer vision tasks include displaying, cropping, flipping, rotating, image segmentation, classification, image restoration, image recognition, image generation. 


- For jupyter notebook can not show in github, we use `gist+nbviewer` method.
    - open <https://nbviewer.org/>
